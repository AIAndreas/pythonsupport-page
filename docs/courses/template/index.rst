Template for new courses
========================

.. tip::

   If you are a teacher and wish your installation guides to be shared
   through the Python support homepage, contact us through
   :mail:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk` or open a :gh-issue:`new issue <new>`.

This is a template functioning as a guideline for creating
a new course guideline.

Courses at DTU using Python will generally update their
package dependencies every year due to the high turn-around
on package versions in the Python ecosystem.

As such it is vital that we retain and store courses for a number of
years so students can always backtrack their work.  
For instance students taking a course in their 1st semester in 2023
may want to return to the material in the 9th semester (now 4 years later).
However, this student will only have access to the old teaching material (they
won't have access to the course material running in year 2027).
Therefore they need to be able to access the material and also the Python
environment in more or less the same manner.

This advocates that we retain courses for several years in a section
fashion.

We propose that instructions are kept for 6 years to allow students to
revisit the instructions. If they stop functioning, please let us know
via :mail:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk`, then we will insert a warning
at the top of the instruction with:

.. warning::

   These instructions are known to not function due to the software progress
   since its usage. It may or may not work.
