Installing Python
=================

.. tip::

   DTU recommends:

   - using the :ref:`Official Python distribution <install-python>`
   - version {{ python_version }} of Python

There are multiple different distributions of Python available.
Python is the base distribution allowing one to run and execute
Python code.

At DTU the most frequently used are the *Python base* based on the
`official Python release <python-org-down_>`_ and
`anaconda <anaconda_>`_.

.. note::

   | Python is a commonly encountered programming language spanning nearly 
     all areas of technology and commerce.
   | The communities around Python are vast and there are **many**
     variants of its installation distributions.

Choosing a Python software installation may seem like a minor decision.
However, different courses may prefer, or require, a specific variant.
Please consult the course guidelines before going forward.
