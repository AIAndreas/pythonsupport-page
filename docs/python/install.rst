Installing Python
=================

Python can relatively easily be installed by following guidelines for each
of the distributions install guides.

.. note::

   Python is a commonly encountered programming language spanning nearly
   all areas of technology and commerce.

   As such the communities around Python are vast and there are **many**
   variants of its installation distributions.

In the following we will concentrate on a few of the most widely used
Python base installations.

.. warning::

   Choosing a Python software installation may seem like a minor decision.
   However, different courses may prefer, or require, a specific variant.
   Please take the time to know about the course requirements before going
