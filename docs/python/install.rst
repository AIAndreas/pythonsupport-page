Installing Python
=================

Python can relatively easily be installed by following guidelines for each
of the distributions install guides.

.. note::

   Python is a commonly encountered programming language spanning nearly
   all areas of technology and commerce.

   As such the communities around Python are vast and there are **many**
   variants of its installation distributions.

In the following we will concentrate on a few of the most widely used
Python base installations.

.. warning::

   Choosing a Python software installation may seem like a minor decision.
   However, different courses may prefer, or require, a specific variant.
   Please take the time to know about the course requirements before going
   forward.



Python base installation
------------------------

The `base Python <python-org_>`_ software can be downloaded and installed through
their `download page <python-org-down_>`_ and uses common installation processes.

Installing this forces you to choose a version, and continuously use that version. I.e. upgrading to
a new Python version requires re-installing a new version, starting from downloading a new installer
and subsequently installing packages through :ref:`pip <install-pip>`.

This variant will *only* install a bare minimum Python executable and standard libraries
associated. Subsequent packages can be installed using :ref:`pip <install-pip>`.

   Make more beautiful documentation, notes, or something else
   Add links to the environments and other vital information.
