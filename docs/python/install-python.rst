Python base installation
------------------------

The `base Python <python-org_>`_ software can be downloaded and installed through
their `download page <python-org-down_>`_ and uses common installation processes.

Installing this forces you to choose a version, and continuously use that version. I.e. upgrading to
a new Python version requires re-installing a new version, starting from downloading a new installer
and subsequently installing packages through :ref:`pip <pip>`.

This variant will *only* install a bare minimum Python executable and standard libraries
associated. Subsequent packages can be installed using :ref:`pip <pip>`.

.. todo:

   Make more beautiful documentation, notes, or something else
   Add links to the environments and other vital information.

Once Python has been installed, head over to :ref:`using pip <pip>` which will be the typical
package installation backend.
