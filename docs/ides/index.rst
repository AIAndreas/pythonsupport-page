Integrated development environment (IDE)
========================================


IDE's is an engineers integral work-horse for creating and executing code.
It generally comprises utilities that aid the programmer for faster development
turn around. Simultaneously it can help with showing documentation for the
API's currently being used.

.. note::
   
   It is recommended that you use :ref:`VS Code <ide-vscode>` when beginning
   your studies at DTU.
   This will be the default IDE for all Polytechnical Foundation courses.

   If you later wish to play around with other IDE's, feel free to do so.
   They are all similar, and different at the same time.

   Please note if course teachers recommends a specific IDE.

They are all good, and generally users prefer one over the others, and primarily
stick with it.
