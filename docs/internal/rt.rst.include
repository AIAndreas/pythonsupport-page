Ticket system (RT)
------------------

Our Ticket system (RT) guideline is:

.. grid:: 1
   :gutter: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: 1. Check for non-closed tickets

      First check if there are any tickets open, where there
      is ongoing communication. If the other supporter is unavailable
      or have not answered for a long period, you can *take* the
      ticket and continue on it
      (please remember the note :ref:`here <internal-com-other>`).

      Quite often, tickets will go in limbo, i.e. the last message
      was from a supporter (us). If there has not been a reply
      for a day, or more, then we can ask whether the question got
      resolved, something like this:

         Hi,

         We hope our suggestions resolved your question?
         If not, please let us know, otherwise we will close it
         in a few days.

         Thanks for reaching out to us!

   .. grid-item-card:: 2. Resume your tickets

      On the ``Homepage`` your tickets listed in
      ``XX highest priority tickets I own`` should be your first
      tickets to resume, and clear.

   .. grid-item-card:: 3. Check for non-taken tickets

      On the ``Homepage`` tickets under the
      ``XX newest unowned tickets`` will be your current
      tickets, prefer to take the oldest ticket.


   .. grid-item-card:: 4. **Take** the ticket

      When you have read the ticket, and think you can solve
      it, **Take** it by clicking on the ticket.
      Now press the ``Actions`` drop-down (top right corner) and select ``Take``.
      Now you are the owner of the ticket, and the other supporters
      can see this.

   .. grid-item-card:: 5. Start communicating

      Try to solve the problem for the questioner.

      Press ``Reply`` from the message you wish to reply to, note that
      *only* older communications will be part of the new message. Generally
      you want to select ``Reply`` on the newest mail. 

      .. note::
         RT will list all mails just like a regular mail client.
         By default, RT displays the oldest messages at the top,
         and the latest at the bottom.

         This default can be changed here:
         ``Logged in as X -> Settings -> Preferences -> Ticket Display -> Show oldest history first``

      .. danger::
         Quite often it is nice with inputs from your other
         supporters. We do this in the ticket system via ``Comments``.
         Be careful about putting sensitive stuff in a comment, when pressing
         reply you'll often have the comments combined in the full message for
         the questioner (sometimes this *can* be useful).

   .. grid-item-card:: 6. Resolving tickets

      When the questioner accepted the solution you should resolve it.
      
      Press the ``Actions`` drop-down (top right corner) and select ``Resolve``.
