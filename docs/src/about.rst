About
=====

The Python support function is an entity consisting of employeed students
to aid and help other stundents if they have problems installing Python
and/or resolving package problems.

Since 2023, DTU will conduct its teaching of the first Mathematics course
and the introduction to programming in the Python programming language.
This is a major transitioning from licensed software (with paid support).

Moving to new software infrastructure will undoubtedly cause some
disturbance to the teaching eco-system.

The Python support, supporting the Polytechnical Foundational courses
is a support unit build around the Python infrastructure to assist
students with problems related to Python installation and Python package
installations.  
We strive to create an open environment where students can ask questions
and seek guidance. It is important for us that students can focus on
what *they* think is important; using software is at many times a tool
to function, and not a development tool.


The Polytechnical foundation is an entity at DTU that defines what
is important for engineers to known as they reach the industry.

Here a loosely translated quote:

   The polytechnical idea is about making natural science breakthroughs
   useful for the society through technology.
   In close to 200 years Ã˜rsteds idea about the interplay between
   a foundational understanding of natural and technical sciences, and how
   these contribute to the development of new technologies for the aid of
   the society.
   DTU's vision for civil engineers is to have a solid
   natural science foundation and a strong technical science core skills.
