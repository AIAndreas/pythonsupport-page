About
=====

The Python support function consists of employed students
to help other students, if problems arise as they install Python
and/or packages.

Since 2023, all DTU students will take all Polytechnical Foundation
courses to sustain a coherent education.
In this context, courses requiring programming,
or software for CAS algebra, will now use Python as their software tool.  
Python is an open-source programming language, and thus, support is limited
to onsite support (us).
This is a major transitioning from licensed software (with paid support).

Such a transition of software infrastructure will undoubtedly cause some
disturbances in the teaching ecosystem.
The Python support, will focus on the Polytechnical Foundation courses
and help students related to Python installation problems encountered
in these courses.

We strive to create an open environment where students can ask questions
and seek guidance. It is important for us that students can focus on
what *they* think is important; using software is, often times a tool
to function, and not a development tool.


The Polytechnical Foundation that steers the DTU students backbone education
is here loosely translated:

   The polytechnical idea is about making natural science breakthroughs
   useful for the society through technology.
   In close to 200 years Ã˜rsteds idea about the interplay between
   a foundational understanding of natural and technical sciences, and how
   these contribute to the development of new technologies for the aid of
   the society.
   DTU's vision for civil engineers is to have a solid
   natural science foundation and a strong technical science core skills.
