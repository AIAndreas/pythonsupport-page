About
=====

The Python support function consists of employed students
to help other students, if they encounter problems when installing Python
and/or packages.

Since 2023, DTU have transitioned to a Polytechnical Foundation
agreement which means that the basic courses students will take are
aligned to a larger extend. In this context courses requiring programming
or software for CAS algebra, will now use Python as their backend.  
Python is an open-source programming language, with no support.
This is a major transitioning from licensed software (with paid support).

Moving to new software infrastructure will undoubtedly cause some
disturbances in the teaching ecosystem.

The Python support, will focus on the Polytechnical Foundation courses
is a support unit build around the Python infrastructure to assist
students with problems related to Python installation and Python package
installations.  
We strive to create an open environment where students can ask questions
and seek guidance. It is important for us that students can focus on
what *they* think is important; using software is at many times a tool
to function, and not a development tool.


The Polytechnical foundation is an entity at DTU that defines what
is important for engineers to known as they reach the industry.

Here a loosely translated quote:

   The polytechnical idea is about making natural science breakthroughs
   useful for the society through technology.
   In close to 200 years Ã˜rsteds idea about the interplay between
   a foundational understanding of natural and technical sciences, and how
   these contribute to the development of new technologies for the aid of
   the society.
   DTU's vision for civil engineers is to have a solid
   natural science foundation and a strong technical science core skills.
