Python support
==============

-- installation for Polytechnical Foundation course
---------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the DTU student support unit, where we help students,
old or new, with installing Python and associated packages for their courses
at DTU.

Our primary goal is to ensure that students can get a functional Python
environment with associated packages requested from course teachers into
a functional state. If you have any questions, we can be contacted via
various channels:

Email - :mail:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk`
   our ticket system based on email. You will get in contact with one
   from our support team.

   We have someone answering tickets every weekday evenings between
   18:00 and 22:00.
Office spaces
   we will have physical presence at DTU Lyngby campus on differing locations
   depending on the used lecture rooms in the `01001`_/`01003`_, `02002`_/`02003`_ courses.
   Once these locations have been fixed we will list a table of locations for the
   semester and expected opening hours.
Discord - `channel <ps-discord-general_>`_ and `invite link <ps-discord-invite_>`_
   Our support team will also be present on the Discord chatting service.

   We have someone answering Monday through Thursday evenings between
   18:00 and 22:00.
   
   Using the Discord channel requires signing up to their terms, we (DTU)
   have no control over Discord and how they use your data. If you feel uncomfortable
   about signing up, please use the email or the physical meet-ups. Otherwise contact
   us for details if needed.


.. note::

   Currently we only support students with installation problems related
   to Python (it self) and packages required in specific courses.
   These courses are 01001, 01003, 02002, 02003.

   Many more will come! Our support unit is new, and we wish to figure
   out what the need is among our students, please do not hesitate
   to contact us regarding other courses, we will use it to understand the
   need for supporting in a broader sense.


.. note::

   If you are a teacher, please visit :ref:`here <teacher-contact>` if you
   wish to post your course installation guidelines here.

.. todo::

   check that the drop down actually works, also look into css settings for
   making it look prettier

.. todo::

   what is a terminal, how to open, how to download, very basic things
   navigate a terminal.

.. todo::

   Create a Quickstart guide

   There is too much information for each of the steps
   It would be ideal with some kind of simple quickstart guide
   which references the sub-pages if there are problems.
